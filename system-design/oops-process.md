# Process of designing a system

1. Identify states in the system
2. Identify interfaces in the system
3. Identify objects of the system
4. Identify interactions of the system
5. Identify correct level of abstraction
5. Repeat until we are confident in design of the system
6. Study from implementation language's perspective.

Look Designing a bad system is easy. A good system should cost a lot in terms of time.

## Keep it simple

Keep interaction design simple.

## A gap between concrete classes

Objects shouldn't know other objects; only their blueprints.

At least one interface should exist for one object.

## Thin interfaces

System should have a lot of interfaces.
