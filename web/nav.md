## Learnings

- You don't have to put everything on a page in one nav
- nav can be for primary navigation or secondary navigation
- there can be many navs on a single page.
- footer items don't need to be in the nav; they can be, but they don't need to be.
- slap an id on your navigational area and use the same id value in aria-labelledby on `<nav>`
- you can put role="navigation" on `<nav>` element.
